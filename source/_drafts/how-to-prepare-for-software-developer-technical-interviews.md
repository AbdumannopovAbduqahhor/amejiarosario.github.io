## Mindset

Don't ask: "Where I'm going to use this on real life?"

Most of the coding questions are stripped out of their background and real-world applications and left with the bare bones.
The goal is that you can understand the problem in 5 min. or less and provide a working solutions in 10 - 30 min. depending on the dificulty.

Improving your problem-solving skills will open you many doors.

This process will make you a better person. This is also true, when you practice an sport (e.g. Running). Let's say you want to run a marathon. To achieve that goal you have to plan ahead, train multiple times per week. You won't become a marathon runner on week 1 nor 2 nor 3. However, if you keep at it, you will be able to run longer and faster. Eventually you become a marathon runner. The same is true for Software Engineering.

You need to prepare for job interviews. Even if you have many years of experience, interviewing is a different skill! This are some things that are different on an interview setting vs your dayjob:
- You don't have to code a solution under 35 min with live code reviews and testing (coding questions).
- You look up things on Stackoverflow/Blogs when you get stuck in an interview you go with your best guess (coding questions).
- You might not have a list of your accomplisments from the top of your head (behavioral questions).
- You don't often design a system from stratch very often and without team's help (design questions).




## Technical Interview Components

- **Behavioral Questions** (Communication skills): Sell yourself, highlight past successes briefly, interesting hobbies.
- **Technical Questions** (Coding/Problem-solving skills): Show you can solve problems quickly using Algorithms and Data Structures.
- **System Design Questions** (Architecture): Designing key components of a new system and identifying bottlenecks and tradeoffs.
- **Domain Knowlege** (Work Experience): Programming languages, frameworks and libraries.
- **Q&A** (Your questions): Ask questions to the interviewer.


### Behavioral Questions

```
I'm a <TITLE>
  *Software Engineer*
at <COMPANY>
  *Cisco*.
I studied at  <PLACE>
  *Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)*
and then I
  *moved to Boston to work full time.*
At my current company, I <JOB ACCOMPLISHMENTS>
  *lead a team where we develop full stack features. I implement the UI work and design the general architecture*
On the side, I <HOBBIES (optional)>
  *I have a technology blog, where I post learnings and explore new topics in depth*
```

Choose 2 or 3 projects to highlight past accomplishments. Try to talk about:
- Technical callenges: architecture, tools tradeoffs.
- Soft Challenges: conflicts among team memebers, leadership, decisions.

### System Design Interview Questions

https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+prepare+for+technical+interview+software+engineer&oq=how+to+prepare+for+technical+interview+as+sof&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0.13085j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

Some examples of common design questions are the following:
1. Design a URL shortening service (like TinyURL or bitly)
2. Design a global video streaming service (like Youtube, Netflix, Twitch)
3. Design a chat app (like WhatsApp, Slack, Facebook Messanger)
4. Design a message board service (like Hacker News, Quora, Reddit)
1. Design a file sharing platform (like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive)


This is what will



### Technical Questions

Technical questions have two main objectives:

- Test how well you know fundamentals of Data Strucutres and Algoriths
- Test you can convert abstract ideas into a programming language code quickly.

So, you should prepare in these two areas. First, cover all the topics and second practice with a stopwatch.
When you are starting out solving problems you will see it will take you hours, or even couple of days if it's a hard one. The goal is to reduce that time to 35 min. or less. There's only 3 ways to achive that: PRACTICE, PRACTICE and more PRACTICE.

For practicing, here are some resources:
- [LeetCode.com](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
- [GeekForGeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

Some recommended books for getting knowledge + exercises:
- [Cracking the Coding Interview (CtCI)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4), Java
- [Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI)](https://www.amazon.com/Tsung-Hsien-Lee/e/B00AA22DV2?ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vu00_taft_p1_i0), Java / Python / C++
- [Data Strucutres and Algorithms (DSA.js)](https://books.adrianmejia.com/dsajs-data-structures-algorithms-javascript/), JavaScript


All the beginnings are though.
If you never run a race before, and you start training you would get tired and would want to give up.
But, if you stick with a proper training, you will become better and would able to achieve a 5k, 10k, and more!

The same happens with coding exercises, you should start easy and work your way towards harder problems. When you complete around 50 or even 100 exercieses of different topics your eyes will open. You will start seeing repeating pattern and that's when your speed will start to improve dramatically. You will start seeing patterns across evercises.


Patterns for Coding Questions.

Sliding windows
Two Pointers
Three Pointers
Sentinel Node


Here's a quick overview of topics and some execises:


## Technical Questions Practices Exercises

### Big O notation

The first thing that you need to be confortable with is Big O notation.
It help you know how performant is your solutions without having to run your program! Magic? Nope, Math!

Here are some free resources:
- [Introduction to Algorithms Analysis](https://adrianmejia.com/how-you-can-change-the-world-learning-data-structures-algorithms-free-online-course-tutorial/)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw


### Arrays Exercises

Arrays is by far the most common data structure and the one you are probably most familar with.
Still, you need to practice to solve the problems quickly and efficiently.

**Refreshers**
You can check out these resources if you need to brush up on the basics:
- https://adrianmejia.com/data-structures-time-complexity-for-beginners-arrays-hashmaps-linked-lists-stacks-queues-tutorial/#Array

**Patterns/Techniques**: 2-pointers, 3-pointers, Sorting, HashMap to speed up lookup.
**Tips**: You should know how to take slice data out of the array, sort, convert strings to arrays and back.

### Strings Exercises

Strings share some similarities with Arrays. However, the main different is that strings are immutable!
So, if you need to modify a string you will have to create a new string or convert it into an array.

**Patterns/Techniques**: Sliding windows, HashMap to speed up finding duplicates, modulus to convert between strings and numbers, Regular Rexpressions.

**Tips**: You should know how strings are represented in memory, and understand basic operations on strings such as comparison, copying, joining, splitting, matching, etc. You should also know about lexicographical ordering and how to operate with immutable strings (convert to an array). Anagrams, Palindromes are also common.
