Tree data structures are very widely used on applications like databases and search applications to name a few. We are going to explore the different types of trees and how to implement them.

In the previous post, we explored the Graph data structures which is a generalized cased of trees. Let's get started learning what are tree data structures! ðŸŒ²

# Trees: basic concepts

Tree is a data structure where a node can zero ore more children. Tree is a type of graph, but not all graphs are trees (only the acyclic undirected graph are trees).

{% img https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_tree.jpg Tree %}

{% img http://www.i-programmer.info/images/stories/BabBag/trees/Tree1.jpg Tree elements %}

As you can see on the graph, the last nodes on a tree is called *leaf*.

The number of levels in a tree is also refered as **height**, represented by *h*.

# Binary Trees

Binary tress are trees that has at most two desendents (children).

A binary tree is one of the most common form of trees and has many applications such as:

- Searching
- Cryptography: [Generate pseudorandom numbers](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall07/cos433/prf_goldreich.pdf)
- Implement peformant [Maps](https://adrianmejia.com/blog/2018/04/28/data-structures-time-complexity-for-beginners-arrays-hashmaps-linked-lists-stacks-queues-tutorial/#HashMaps) and [Sets](https://adrianmejia.com/blog/2018/04/28/data-structures-time-complexity-for-beginners-arrays-hashmaps-linked-lists-stacks-queues-tutorial/#Sets) data structures.
- Implement priority queues

## Full, Complete and Perfect binary trees

Depending on how many nodes arrangements a binary tree can be **full**, **complete** and **perfect**:
- **Full binary tree**: each node has 0 or 2 children
- **Complete binary tree**: when all levels except the last one are full with nodes.
- **Perfect binary tree**: when all the levels (including the last one) are full with nodes.

<!-- If each node has only two children (left and right) we call it **Binary Tree**. -->

<!-- A binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children then it said to be a **full binary tree** -->

<!-- When a binary is perfect and comple, it is called a **Perfect Binary Tree**. -->
{% img http://www.csie.ntnu.edu.tw/~u91029/BinaryTree2.png full Binary Tree %}

<!-- **Complete binary tree** is when all levels except the last one are filled with nodes. -->


You can also have a combination of full and complete binary trees:
{% img https://gsourcecode.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/complete-full-trees1.png "Complete/Full binary tree" %}


<!-- If each non-leaf node on a binary tree has two descendents then we say is a **complete tree** -->

<!-- { img https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Trees/pix/full_complete.bmp caption } -->

Perfect binary trees have \`2^k - 1\`, where *`k`* is the last level of tree (starting with 1).


## Binary Search Trees (BST)

Binary Search Trees or BST for short are a special application of binary trees. BST has at most two nodes (like all binary trees), however, the values are in such a way that the left children value must be less than the parent and the right children is must be higher.

BST vs non-BST


## Balanced vs Non-balanced Trees

It's important to keep the balance on trees, especially when using Binary Search Trees to guarantee a search time of *`O(log n)`*. If the tree is not balanced, then the search time won't be any different than searching a value on a LinkedList *`O(n)`*.

{% img http://www.stoimen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/3.-Balanced-vs.-Non-Balanced.png Balanced vs unbalanced Tree %}

Perfect binary trees are always balanced because their height is the lowest possible given the number of nodes

\`|~ log_2 (n + 1) ~|\`

or

*`Math.ceil( Math.log2(n  + 1) )`*, where *`n`* is the total number of nodes.

However, perfect binary trees are not very common in the real world. We just want to gurantee a search time of *`O(log n)`*. Relaxing a little bit the definition we can say that a tree is balanced if:
1. The left subtree height and the right subtree height differ by at most 1.
2. Left and right subtree are balanced (using rule **#1**)

For instance, if you have a tree with 7 nodes:

```
1          A
         /   \
2       B     C
       /     / \
3     D     E   F
           /
4         G
```

If you check the subtrees heights recursevely you will notice they never differ by more than on.
- `A` descendants:
  - `B` subtree has a height of 2, while `C` has a height of 3. The difference is less than one so: Balanced!
- `C` descendents:
  - `E` subtree has a height of 2, while `F` has a height of 1: Balanced!

On the other hand, take a look at this tree:

```
1          A
         /   \
2       B     C
       /     /
3     D     E
           /
4         G
```

Let's check the subtrees height recursively:
- `A` descendants:
  - `B` subtree has a height of 2, while `C` has a height of 3. The difference is less than one so: Balanced!
- `C` descendents:
  - `E` subtree has a height of 2, while the right subtree (of `C`) has a height of 0. The difference between 2 and 0 is more than one, so: NOT balanced!
