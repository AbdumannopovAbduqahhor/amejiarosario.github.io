Most professions nowadays involve a certain degree of stress. We have deadlines to meet, change of requirements at the last minute and to deal with people. On top of that, when you work in front of a computer 8+ days your eyes get dry if you don't take a break from screens. Your muscles get shrink while your belly expands ;). This post is about some ways that you can get your job done without sacrificing your health.

Software developers also have some added challenges. Technology changes at a very rapid pace, and you have not just have to catch up but also innovate to bring value to your users.

# Background

There was a time in my life, back in 2015, where I went through severe stress anxiety. I was juggling too many things at once: writing a book, interviewing in the USA for new jobs and getting a work visa, planning a wedding in another country while keeping up with a full-time job (working from home) and also the sole programmer on two startups. It was the busiest time of my life, and my health suffered a lot!

I dreamt in the source code. Most nights I couldn't sleep, so often I worked instead. I went to the ER multiple times with heart palpitations. I knew I could not keep doing what I was doing. Since then, I've been incorporating the following techniques and had helped me a lot. Hope they can help you too!

# Ideas to handle stress

## Break ‚è≤

Follow every 25 min of focused work by a 5 min break. You can also do 50/10 minutes of work/break. What matters is that you get some break to move around and take a deep breath.

Movement = Energy. You might notice that after a long time sitting your energy levels and concentration start to drop. Taking a break to get some movements is great to solve this issue.

The 25/5 minutes of work/break is also known as the Pomodoro technique.  There are many apps that I have used to remind me to take a break. As simple as it sounds, it's easy to get carried away when working on code and lose the notion of time.

My favorite is Recess because it blacks out the screen when the timer is over. Other ones have a sound that I can subconsciously ignore and keep going.

Be Focus is another one. Has a todo and keep track of completed tasks.

Taking breaks to reduce eye strain. I suffer from dry eyes from time to time. When we stare at a digital screen, we don't blink as often causing our eyes dryness.  There's also a rule of thumb 20-20-20. Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
At one point I also notice that my eyesight was getting worse, so I also incorporated some eyes exercises during the break. That also helped with the dryness a lot!

## Brainstorm üß†

Sometimes there is a better way to accomplish a task that you are stuck with. There might be a straighter line to get to your goal. List all the alternatives you can think of (don't label them as good or bad. Put it all down "smart" ideas and especially the "dumb" ones). Choose the ones that you think will work the best. Work smarter, not harder!

If you are going to cut a tree is important to sharpen your ax first and then get to it. Not just will you cut the tree faster but also with less effort. Likewise, it's vital that you take some time to do a little planning before jumping right into the task in hand. Beware of not overdoing it, set a time limit for this exercise. If you spend all the time sharpening the ax and never cut the tree is not good either ;)

## Subtask ‚úåÔ∏è

Divide a big task into smaller ones. Completing some small tasks will motivate you to get more done. Also keeps the stress away since you feel you are making progress.

Even the most ambitious projects and tallest buildings started with laying down one brick/block. Likewise, no matter how big your project is when you break it down into smaller pieces, it makes it easier to reason about.

Tackling a small task is less daunting to deal with the project as a whole, so you will be less likely to procrastinate and stress about it.

## Prioritize üéØ

Most of us have an endless TODO list where things get added a lot faster than we can check them off. An infinite list of things to do, stress us big time. What if I tell, that in most cases you only need to finish the 20% of list reap 80% of the benefits? üò≤

If you can't do it all, then prioritize. Do what matters the most upfront. The 20% of the task might account for 80% of the result (Pareto Principle). Find that critical 20% and execute on that first. For the rest of the task, you can apply the 80/20 principle recursively. Find the next 20% that matters the most and for the rest apply Pareto again, delegate or re-evaluate if is still needed.

## Ask üó£

Ask for help. If you have more on your plate more than you can chew, then share with others. Don't choke alone.

When you request for help, the other person usually feels good. You are creating a bond and companionship with that person. However, don't overdo it! Otherwise, it will have the opposite effect. Before asking for help, you should do your homework. Try to solve it yourself first, google it and struggle a little bit with it. Write down some questions and where you get stuck (exact error messages, etc.) The other person will appreciate that you are respecting their time and that you are asking detailed questions.


## Drink üö∞

Stay hydrated. Your brain is mostly water so don't let it dry. A good rule of thumb is to drink half of your weight in ounces (e.g., 170lb -> 85 oz. water).

Your body is a fantastic machine that tries to keep the balance regardless of what we throw at it. It remains a certain temperature when it's freezing by shivering or sweating when it's hot. It seeks to maintain the pH of your blood even if you drink too many acidic beverages (sodas, coffee). It tries to keeps your blood sugar on check even after eating a donut or if haven eaten in hours. However, our bodies need the proper nutrients and water to do so. When you don't hydrate yourself enough, it can't remove the waste out of your system. So, drink up!

Another way to know if you are hydrated is monitoring how often your pee (crazy, right?). If you haven't pee in 3 hours, you need two glasses of water ASAP.

## Nourish ü•¶

How productive are you when you are sick? Exactly! You get almost nothing done. On top of that, your stress increases and the deadlines get closer. A well-nourish body gets sick less and has more energy. You would be more productive!

Supplement yourself with vitamin C (fruits).  Vitamin C helps your body to quickly clear out Cortisol, which is a hormone correlated to stress. It also keeps your immune system healthy. Magnesium from leafy greens helps to relax the muscles among many other benefits.

Try to incorporate these foods into your diet:

- Nuts (Omegas 3 - good for your brain)
- Fish (Omegas 3 - good for your mind)
- Vegetable of different colors
- Leafy greens
- Fruits

## Stretch üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Prolonged sitting is the new smoke. It might increase your body weight, back, and neck pain. Even if you exercise an hour before/after work, still you are hurting yourself for sitting too long at once. You have to break sitting often.

Break sitting every 25 minutes or an hour with some stretching session. Our bodies are not designed to stay 8 hours per day sitting. It was designed to move. Indeed, great ideas happen when you are on the move (showering/walking). If you are stuck with some task, take a little walk and might give you some perspective.

## Workout üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Move your butt often, get some sweat in your forehead. Working out releases endorphins that increase your sense of well-being.

Working out your muscles can help you release tension and reduce your mental stress. However, don't overdo it or it can backfire you. Try to avoid getting injured by doing small progressive changes rather than going too big the first day and then not being able to walk nor shower.

## Breath üí®

If you are reading this, it means you are breathing (of course!). However, not all breaths are equal!  üëÄ

Take some very deep and slow breaths from time to time. When we are stressed out, we breathe very fast and shallow.

Proper breathing is vital for relaxation. You can avoid/overcome panic attacks. Just sitting relaxed and being aware of your breath when the air goes in and out can cool off your mind, reduce your heartbeats and blood pressure.

Some devices can track when you are tense, focus or calm. Guess how they do it? That's right with your breathing.
I have use Spire. I think it's useful to know track receive feedback when I was getting tense and try to take some deep breadth right there.

## Meditate üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Meditation is trending but still sounds a little strange for some people. Simply put, meditation is focusing on the "now" because most of the time we get carried away fearing "future" situations that might never happen or worrying about a "past" that we can't change. All we got is "now".

One of the best ways to be present is being aware of your breathing. It's always in the present. So, the basis of meditation is mindful of your breath, and that alone can be calming.

There are many apps that you can use for helping you pick up the habit of being present and relax:

- Breethe
- Simple Habit
- Calm
- Headspace

I'm sure there are many other apps for this but this is the ones I've used, and they are in my order of preference.

## Play üéÆ

After a long session of work, what's your reward? If you go home to continue working and or doing mentally taxing activities, then you will burn out quickly!

If you don't rest properly, the next day your focus will be all over the place. Also, the urge to procrastinate will be strong in you. Your mind will be looking for any chance to get a break.

Solution? Have some **planned** downtime! After some time of work well done, reward yourself with something that you enjoy. Playtime! Do something that put a smile on your face üòä.  Do something that makes you laugh ü§£. The life can't be all broccoli and not desert. Have some fun and plan for it!

## Write ‚úçÔ∏è

Journaling is one thing that helped me the most to calm my racing mind before going to sleep.

Use journals to write down thoughts, worries, plans, and let your mind run wild. Also, it helps a lot to write down things you are grateful on that day. It would make you feel better when you see written down some things turn out great on that day!  Even in the worse days, there are a few things that you can be thankful for.

Like brainstorming doesn't label your writing as bad or good. Just let it flow and write down what's on your mind.

Some people do it in the morning like Tim Ferris, I have seen a lot of benefits doing it at night. Find the time that works the best for you.

## Sleep üò¥

I neglected this one for some time. The truth is that we sometimes we think if we sleep less we would have more time to get stuff done. However, that's not usually true. Your productivity/creativity decreases so much. If you are well-rested, you can solve problems in much less time.

The science of what happens while we sleep is still ongoing and fascinating. We know that memory consolidation happens while you sleep, your body repair itself, waste is removed from the brain. Your heart rate drops around 20%, and your stress hormones go down. Your nervous systems heal making you more responsive and sharp after a good night sleep.

Also, we have an idea of what happens when we don't sleep much for a couple of days. We have problems concentrating. The quality of our work decreases and or creativity suffers. You might have headaches, darker shades under your eyes among other things.

Do you know having a good night sleep start during the day? For most people, it's hard to sleep well (or at all) after a very stressful day or some big event coming up. That's why doing breathing exercises throught the day helps. Also, taking breaks every 25 or 50 minutes of work. Journaling helps me a lot to calm down my monkey mind jumping all over the place at night.
