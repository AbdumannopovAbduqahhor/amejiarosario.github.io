Deadlines, change of requirements, side projects, scope creeps get us all stress out. As a developer, you need to find ways to manage stress otherwise your health will suffer and your productivity too! This post covers many ways that can help you cope with stress.

There was a time in my life, back in 2015, where I went a severe stress anxiety. I was writing a book, interviewing in the USA for new jobs and getting a work visa, planning a wedding in another country while keeping up with a full-time job and also the sole programmer on 2 startups. It was the busiest time of my life, and my health suffered a lot. I couldn't sleep. I dreamt in code and wake up early to keep coding. I went to the ER multiple times with heart palpitations. Since then, I've been incorporating the following techniques and had helped me a lot. Hope they can help you too!

## Ideas to handle stress

1. **Breath**. Take deep and slow breaths from time to time.

  <p>When we are stressed our breathing changes.  We start breathing very fast and shallow. There are devices that can send you a notification when you are streesed. Guess what they do? Exactly, the count your breadths per minute and if it's below certain threshold you are stressed.</p>

  <p>So if you find youself on this  pattern, take a break. Take some slow and deep breadths.</p>

13. **Break**. Use the Pomodoro technique. Work for 25 min and take a 5 min break (#8 stretch. Take your eyes off screens, drink some water and go to the farthest restroom)


2. **Mediatate**. Combine the breathing with the whole body scans and visualizations

3. **Vitamins**. Supplement your vitamin C and magnesium intake. Vitamin C keeps your immune system healthy and also helps to combat the effects of the stress. Magnesium helps to relax the muscles.
4. **Write**. Use journals to write down thoughts, worries, plans, and let your mind run wild.
5. **Play**. After a session of work have some time to relax and do something you enjoy.
6. **Laugh**. Don't take life too seriously; you won't escape alife anyways so enjoy the journey. Watch funny videos, make fun of yourself.
7. **Workout**. Move your butt often, get some sweat in your forehead. Working out releases endorphins that increase your sense of well-being
8. **Streach**. Prolonged sitting is the new smoke. Break sitting every 30 minutes or an hour with some stretching session.
9. **Ask**. Ask for help. If you have on your plate more than you can chew then share with others. Don't choke.
10. **Subtask**. Divide a big task into smaller ones. Completing some small tasks will motivate you to get more done.
11. **Prioritize**. If you can't do it all, then do what matters the most upfront. 20% of the task might account for 80% of the result. Find that critical 20% and delegate the rest if needed.
12. **Brainstorm**. Sometimes there is a better way to do things. List all the alternatives you can think of (dumb and smart ones, put it all down) and choose the ones that you think will work the best. Work smarter, not harder!
14. **Drink**. Stay hydrated. Your brain is mostly water so don't let it dry. Drink half of your weight in ounces (e.g., 170lb -> 85 oz.). Another way to know if you are hydrated is monitoring your pee (crazy, right?). If you haven't pee in 3 hours, you need two glasses of water ASAP.
