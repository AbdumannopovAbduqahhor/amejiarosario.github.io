Welcome to this series of tutorials that will take you through the world of Angular 2 and friends!

JavaScript has changed a lot lately and so did Angular 2. It now uses ES6, TypeScript, Webpack, RxJS and other technologies.
You might feel overwhelmed, but fret not. This tutorial is going to take you step-by-step where you need to go.

These tutorials will only assume that you know are familiar with JavaScript/HTML/CSS. You might or might not have use Angular 1 before so we are going to explain the concepts from scratch. And, make reference to Angular 1 just for people that were familiar with it.

We are going to start with learning Angular 2. We are going to use Angular CLI to get us off the ground and then work our way into the core concepts.

Later, we go in-depth into each one of the technologies used in Angular 2. That way, you can understand better how things work under the hood.
